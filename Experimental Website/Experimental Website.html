        <h2>This website is designed on experimental purpose for learning CSS.</h2>
        <h3>Let's see how HTML works.</h3>
        <p>Here I used a P attribute which refers to paragraph.<hr>
            Though I used bgcolor attribute, we can't see it.<br/>
            Because a background image has also been attached.</p>
        <p align="center">This line is aligned in center.</center></p>
        <!--Styling tags will be shown now-->
        <pre>Now we will see some styling attributes.</pre>
        <b>Here b attribute is used to make the line bold.</b><br>
        <i>Here i attribute is used to make the line italic.</i><br>
        <small>Here small attribute is used to make the font smaller than usual.</small>
        <p>The subscript tag is used when we need to display a text half a character below the baseline.
            <br>e.g: H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
           The superscript tag is used when we need to display a text half a character above the baseline.
           <br>e.g: (a+b)<sup>2</sup><br>
        </p>
        <p> Here I am using "a" attribute which is used to attach any hyperlink.<br>
        This link is an <a href="https://html.com/">HTML</a> learning website as example.<br>
    If the link is supposed to open in a new tab, we have to use target="_blank" attribute like below,<br>
    <p>
    We will see a form <a href="Form.html" target="_blank">here</a> 
    and learn about remaining tags and attributes of HTML.<br><br>
    Go to last <a href="Tables and Lists.html" target="_blank">page</a> 
    where we can learn about Table and List tags.<br>
    </p></p>
